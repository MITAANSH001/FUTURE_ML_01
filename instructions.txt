In this task, you will build a sales or demand forecasting system using historical business data.

Sales forecasting is one of the most widely used Machine Learning applications in real businesses. Companies rely on forecasts to:

plan inventory
manage cash flow
prepare staffing
avoid overstocking or losses
This task helps you understand how Machine Learning supports real business decisions, not just how to train a model.

🎯 Objective
Your goal is to predict future sales or demand based on past data and present the results in a clear, business-friendly way.

Instead of focusing only on accuracy, you will also learn:

how to prepare time-based data
how to explain trends and seasonality
how forecasts help business planning

✅ What You’ll Do
As part of this task, you will:

Clean and prepare historical sales data
Create time-based features (date, month, seasonality)
Apply forecasting techniques (regression or time-series methods)
Evaluate model performance and errors
Visualize forecasts so non-technical stakeholders can understand them
